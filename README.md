Agia Academy matches netrunners with rookies, and sends them on adventures.

* A netrunner is a professional in IT with a technical skill. They could be a programmer, a network engineer, a database administrator, a hacker, or one of many other technical roles.
* A rookie is somebody who is interested in a closer, more personal look into the tech field. They could aspire to become a netrunner themselves, or simply enjoy being a participant in a netrunner's adventures.
* An adventure is a session in which a netrunner and a rookie work on building something, or solving a real technical problem together. The nature of the adventure is up to the netrunner.

For example, a netrunner might pick an open-source code project on GitHub to contribute to, and bring a rookie along for a pair-programming session.\
Another example of an adventure could involve a netrunner exploring a new technology they are interested in, and bringing a rookie along for their learning or hacking session.\
A netrunner could also work on their cyberdeck, or that of their rookie. We've heard that many people refer to their cyberdecks as "personal websites," but we find that this definition is too limiting.

We encourage netrunners to be as creative as they'd like in their choice of adventures. The more productive, fulfilling, and fun the adventure -- the better.\
We encourage rookies to be patient and open-minded during their adventures. Sometimes they will be exciting, engaging, easy, and successful. Other times, they will be boring, frustrating, difficult, and unsuccessful. The key is keep going on adventures, keep learning, and have fun even when you fail.

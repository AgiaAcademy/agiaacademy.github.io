# Hi
Hi there! I’m Max. You’re reading this because you’ve expressed interest in learning a thing or
two about Web Development. Lucky for you, I’m interested in teaching it! Hopefully I don’t suck.

To start, I’ve put together a learning program for us. It consists of the following:
- Topics we’ll be learning
- Resources to help us learn, practice, and communicate about our progress
- List of tools used day-to-day by developers that you should get familiar with
- The process for how I’ll be helping you guys along the way

I’m calling our little group Agia Academy, and you will be able to find all the resources I’m
referencing here on academy.agia.io. Why? For those who don’t know, Agia is the name of the web
design & development company I started ( agia.io ), so I am just giving this initiative some context,
character, and using some of my business’s tools to run it. Read on!

# Goals
Here’s my short list of goals for our program:
- Learn some front-end programming and scripting
..- HTML
..- CSS
..- JavaScript
- Get introduced to free tools and services to learn and practice web development
- Get familiar with a number of tools used in day-to-day development & programming
..- IDE's (Integrated Development Environments) and code editors like Visual Studio, VS
Code, Sublime Text
..- Source control (Git)
..- Hosting (GitHub, Azure)
- Build your very own first, real website, and put it out there!

The first big milestone here is for each of you to build your own website, yourself (with my
help), and put it out into the world. Sounds intimidating, but it’s not so bad – I have it all more or less
planned out.

For now, this won’t be a timed program (ie: 4 weeks, 10 weeks, etc), as I’d like to see how we
progress naturally the first time around. If this changes I will let you know
